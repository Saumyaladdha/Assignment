Leader in the Array: The solution finds elements in an array that are greater than all the elements to their right. It iterates from right to left, updating a maximum value and storing elements that are greater than this maximum.

Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock: This problem was solved by iterating through the stock prices array, tracking the minimum price up to each day, and calculating the maximum profit that could be made by selling on each day.
